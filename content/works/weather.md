# Experience Analysis through Weather Data 
Knowing accurate weather conditions is an important element for individuals as well as organizations. Many businesses rely on weather conditions. It is necessary to have the correct data to get accurate decisions. One type of data that’s easier to find on the internet is Weather data. Many sites provide historical data on many meteorological parameters.

> The Analysis project was done as a part of my Data Analytics Internship at [Suven Consultants & Technology](https://suvenconsultants.com/).

### Objective
The main objective is to perform data cleaning, perform analysis for testing the Influences of Global Warming on temperature and humidity, and finally put forth a conclusion.

### Hypothesis
The Null Hypothesis H0 is “Has the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming” — That means we need to find whether the average Apparent temperature for the month of a month says April starting from 2006 to 2016 and the average humidity for the same period have increased or not.

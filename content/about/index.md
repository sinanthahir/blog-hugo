## ðŸ‘‹ Hello world!
My name is Sinan Thahir. I'm currently working as a [Research Analyst](/timeline) and a life long learner - mostly *analytics* and *research* in the field of **data**. 

Besides loving my job and my side hustle, I love to read books, play video games and scribbling. I love travelling and exploring new places, meeting new people and learning about their culture, traditions and food.

> For more details about my education and my past experiences, take a look at my [timeline](/timeline) or [resume]().

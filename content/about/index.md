## 👋 Hello world!
My name is Sinan Thahir. I'm currently working as a [Research Analyst](/timeline) and a life long learner - mostly *design,* *analytics* and *research*. 

Since beginning my journey as a student; nearly for the last 6-7 years, I’ve been deeply involved in the technology and business domain. As a fact ended up my path in **Bachelors in Technology** degree.

#### Interested in the entire design and operations research spectrum and would love to work on ambitious projects with positive people.

Apart from these, I had done remote work for event agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people in creating  products for both business and consumer use as well as in research.

> For more details about my past experiences and my education, take a look at my [Credentials](/credentials) or [Resume](sinresume.pdf).

Besides loving my job and my side hustle, I love to read books and scribbling. Fan of English Premier League, Outdoor activities, Series/Anime and English literature.

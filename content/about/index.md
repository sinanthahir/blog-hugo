## 👋 Hello world!
My name is Sinan Thahir. I'm currently working as a [Research Analyst](/timeline) and a life long learner - mostly *analytics* and *research* in the field of **data**. 

Since beginning my journey as a student; nearly for the last 6-7 years, I’ve been deeply involved in the technology and business domain. As a fact ended up my path in **Bachelors in Technology** degree. But in the mean time `Data & Analytics` became a part of me.

#### Interested in the entire analytics spectrum and would love to work on ambitious projects with positive people.

Besides loving my job and my side hustle, I love to read books, play video games and scribbling. Fan of English Premier League, Outdoor activities, Series/Anime and English literature.

Apart from these, I had done remote work for event agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people in creating  products for both business and consumer use as well as in research.
